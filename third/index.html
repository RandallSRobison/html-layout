            <div id="text">If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
                    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
                And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
                    And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
                If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
                    To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>   
                And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
                    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’<br>
                If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>   
                    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
                If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
                    If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
                If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
                    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>   
                Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>   
                    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!</div>
